# Pleiotropy and Disease Interactors

This repository contains the code and data resources required to reproduce the analyses presented in the study 
“Pleiotropy and Disease Interactors: The Dual Nature of Genes Linking Ageing and Ageing-related Diseases”.

The repository is organized into two main components: code and data. 
The code directory includes all scripts used in this study and references the corresponding data locations for loading inputs and saving outputs. 
The data directory is divided into retrieved and generated datasets, each organized into structured subdirectories. 
Due to GitHub file size limitations, not all datasets could be uploaded directly; large files and databases exceeding these limits are therefore provided via external data links, as indicated in the documentation.

General information on the repository structure is provided in this README. 
Detailed descriptions of the analysis pipeline, individual scripts, and data organization are available in the accompanying documentation files.
