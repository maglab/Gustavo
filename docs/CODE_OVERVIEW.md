**Code overview**

The pipeline is organized into six main components:
  1.	Genes and Data Retrieval
  2.	Pleiotropy and Disease Association Analysis
  3.	Network Analysis
  4.	Co-expression and Tissue Specificity
  5.	Machine Learning
  6.	Functional Enrichment Analysis

Each section corresponds to a folder in the repository and reflects a logical stage of the analysis.
