The pipeline is organized into six main components:

Genes and Data Retrieval
Pleiotropy and Disease Association Analysis
Network Analysis
Co-expression and Tissue Specificity
Machine Learning
Functional Enrichment Analysis
Each section corresponds to a folder in the repository and reflects a logical stage of the analysis.
