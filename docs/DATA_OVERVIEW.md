# Data overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the data used and generated in this study. 
It is intended to help readers quickly understand the types of data involved, their origin, and how they relate to the analysis pipeline. 
For a detailed, directory-level description of all files and subfolders, see `DATA_ORGANIZATION.md`.

## Data categories

The data in this repository are divided into two main categories:

### Retrieved data

Retrieved data include all external datasets and reference resources used as inputs for the analyses. 
These data are not generated by this study and originate from established public repositories and published studies.

Retrieved data comprise:
- Gene and disease annotation resources
- Gene–disease association datasets
- Network source data for PPI, KEGG, and co-expression networks
- Tissue expression and tissue specificity reference data
- GWAS summary statistics used for SNP-to-gene mapping

These datasets serve as the foundational inputs for network construction, pleiotropy analyses, permutation tests, and machine learning feature generation.

### Generated data

Generated data include all intermediate and final outputs produced during the analyses presented in this work. 
These data are derived from the retrieved datasets through computational processing, statistical analysis, and machine learning.

Generated data comprise:
- Gene Ontology enrichment results
- Constructed biological networks and their associated graph objects
- Network-based distance and proximity matrices
- Machine learning datasets and ageing gene prediction results
- Permutation test results and associated summary statistics
- Intermediate data used for visualization of co-expression and tissue specificity

Generated data are organized to reflect the logical stages of the analysis pipeline and enable reproducibility of all reported results.

## Relationship to the analysis pipeline

Retrieved data are first processed and integrated during the data retrieval stage of the pipeline. 
Subsequent analysis modules transform these inputs into generated datasets, which are then reused across network analysis, permutation testing, and machine learning stages.

This separation between retrieved and generated data ensures transparency, reproducibility, and clear provenance of all results.

## Data access

Due to GitHub file size limitations, some large retrieved datasets and generated intermediate files are not hosted directly in this repository. 
All processed and generated datasets associated with this study are available via external data links, as described in the main README and the Data Availability section of the manuscript.
